Dealing with traffic congestion is one of the most difficult challenges for big cities. The use of reversible 
lanes is a common strategy to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane is a lane that can 
change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzAGqOfDANM&ab_channel=PermaGrinFilms).

Adaptive lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations.
The original simulator is in [volkhin](https://github.com/volkhin/RoadTrafficSimulator), I am just making changes to it 
for my needs, which are in my GitHub [RoadTrafficSimulator](https://github.com/davidguzmanr/RoadTrafficSimulator).
Here is a [demo](https://davidguzmanr.github.io/files/RoadTrafficSimulator.html).
