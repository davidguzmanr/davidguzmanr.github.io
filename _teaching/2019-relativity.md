I was teacher assistant in the *Relativity* class, my job was to design the assignments, reinforce the lessons 
given in class, give students useful tools and support them in doubts that could arise. The assignments of the
class are [here](http://cuerdas.fisica.unam.mx/) in the *Lectures' documents* section.
