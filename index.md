I'm an incoming PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en), where I’ll be working under the supervision of [David Adelani](https://dadelani.github.io/).

I hold a [Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) from [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), as well as a BSc in Physics from [Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM](http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/) and a BSc in Data Science from [IIMAS, UNAM](https://www.iimas.unam.mx/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Multilingual NLP**, **Low-Resource Languages**, and, more recently, **Trustworthy Machine Learning**.

Outside of research, I really like photography, especially **landscapes** and **astrophotography**.
