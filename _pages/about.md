About me
=====

I am currently at University of Toronto pursuing a [Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/).

I have a BSc in *Physics* from [Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM](http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/) and a BSc in *Data Science* from
[IIMAS, UNAM](https://www.iimas.unam.mx/). 

My interests are centered around Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and lately Trustworthy Machine Learning. I developed these interests during my Physics and Data Science degrees that further drove me to pursue a MSc in Applied Computing at University of Toronto.
